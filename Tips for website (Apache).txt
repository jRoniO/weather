sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2

#So let’s start by creating a folder for our new website in /var/www/ by running
sudo mkdir /var/www/gci/

#Now that we have a directory created for our site, lets have an HTML file in it.
# Let’s go into our newly created directory and create one by typing:

cd /var/www/gci/
nano index.html

#Paste the following code in the index.html file:
<html>
<head>
  <title> Ubuntu rocks! </title>
</head>
<body>
  <p> I'm running this website on an Ubuntu Server server!
</body>
</html>

#Now let’s create a VirtualHost file so it’ll show up when we type in gci.example.com.
#We start this step by going into the configuration files directory:

cd /etc/apache2/sites-available/
sudo cp 000-default.conf gci.conf

#Now edit the configuration file:
sudo nano gci.conf

#We should have our email in ServerAdmin so users can reach you in case Apache experiences any error:
ServerAdmin yourname@example.com

#We also want the DocumentRoot directive to point to the directory our site files are hosted on:
DocumentRoot /var/www/gci/
The default file doesn’t come with a ServerName directive so we’ll have to add and define it by adding this line below the last directive:

#ServerName gci.example.com
#This ensures people reach the right site instead of the default one when they type in 
gci.example.com.
#Now that we’re done configuring our site, let’s save and activate it in the next step!
#After setting up our website, we need to activate the virtual hosts configuration file to enable it. 
#We do that by running the following command in the configuration file directory:

sudo a2ensite gci.conf
#You should see the following output
"Enabling site gci.
To activate the new configuration, you need to run:
  service apache2 reload
root@ubuntu-server:/etc/apache2/sites-available#"

#To load the new site, we restart Apache by typing:

service apache2 reload
